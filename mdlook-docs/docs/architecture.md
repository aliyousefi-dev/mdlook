# Architecture

it serve all markdowns. and then render them on client frontend locally. you can serve the output with anything.

---

## Static Serve

it serve all markdown as public statics

```
nav.md
- docs
    - content01.md
    - content02.md
    - content03.md
- assets
    - img.png
```

## Internal Renderer

it uses the `MarkdownRendererComponent` to render the markdown.
it render the markdown internally. in client frontend.
also wrap that and create a custom language for that also.

## Sync Nav

The Sync function sync the `nav.md` file.

### Nav Structure

```
# MDLook <!-- Doc Header Title -->

if there is a same name on outside the sub pages going under that with intend.
if there is not any same name as folder. it create a title and they going under that title.
